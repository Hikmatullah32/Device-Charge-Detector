# Device-Charge-Detector
The purpose of a device charge detector is to provide a simple and reliable way to keep track of the battery status of electronic devices such as cell phones, laptops, and other portable devices. By monitoring the charge level, users can avoid running out of power when they need it most and can also avoid overcharging, which can damage the battery.
